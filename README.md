# Auditracker

A VSCode extension for tracking code audit progress. Mark files as in-scope, track function review status, and identify entrypoints.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nisedo/auditracker.git && cd auditracker && npm install && npm run compile && npx vsce package && code --install-extension auditracker-*.vsix --force
```

## Features

- **Scope Management**: Right-click files or folders in the Explorer to add/remove from audit scope
- **File Decorations**: In-scope files display a 📌 badge in the Explorer
- **Function Tracking**: Automatically extracts all functions from in-scope files
- **Review Status**: Track functions as unread, read, or reviewed
- **Filtering**: Filter the panel by status and tags (unread/read/reviewed/entrypoint/admin)
- **Entrypoints**: Mark critical functions as entrypoints for special visibility (❗️)
- **Admin Functions**: Mark admin/privileged functions for security-focused review (🔐)
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically loads `contracts/`, `src/`, `lib/`, or `sources/` folder when no scope is defined
- **SCOPE File Support**: Auto-load scope from `SCOPE.txt` or `SCOPE.md` at workspace root
- **Navigation**: Click any function to jump to it with temporary highlighting
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic daily progress tracking with detailed markdown reports
- **Persistence**: State is saved per-workspace in `.vscode/{repo-name}-auditracker.json`

## Usage

### Adding Files to Scope

**Auto-Discovery**: When you first open a workspace, Auditracker automatically scans for common source folders (`contracts/`, `src/`, `lib/`, `sources/`) and loads the first one found. No manual setup needed for most projects.

**Manual**: Right-click a file or folder in the Explorer and select **Auditracker: Add to Scope**.

**SCOPE File**: Create a `SCOPE.txt` or `SCOPE.md` file at your workspace root with one path per line:

```
src/contracts/Token.sol
src/contracts/Vault.sol
lib/utils/
```

The scope file is auto-loaded when no existing config is found. Use the **Auditracker: Load Scope File** command to manually reload it.

### Removing from Scope

Use **Auditracker: Remove from Scope** on a file or folder.

If a folder is in scope and you remove a single file, Auditracker remembers that file as **excluded**. To include it again, run **Auditracker: Add to Scope** on that file.

### Tracking Progress

Functions display with three states:

| Icon | Status | Description |
|:----:|--------|-------------|
| ○ | **Unread** | Not yet reviewed |
| 👁 | **Read** | Read but not fully reviewed (yellow) |
| ✓ | **Reviewed** | Fully reviewed (green) |

**Workflow**: Functions must be marked as "read" before they can be marked as "reviewed". Click the inline button or right-click to change status.

### Filtering Functions

Use **Auditracker: Filter Functions** (or the filter icon in the panel title) to control which functions are shown.

- Status filters: unread/read/reviewed (you can select any combination)
- Tag filters: entrypoint/admin

Filters are combined as: **(status matches) AND (tag matches)**. If you select multiple tags, a function matches if it has **any** selected tag.

Use **Auditracker: Clear Function Filter** to reset back to showing everything.

### Hiding Functions

Some functions (like abstract declarations or trivial getters) may not need review. Right-click a function and select **Hide Function** to remove it from the panel. Hidden functions:
- Don't appear in the function list
- Don't count toward review progress
- File description shows hidden count (e.g., "3/10 reviewed (2 hidden)")

To restore hidden functions, right-click the file and select **Show Hidden Functions**.

### Marking Entrypoints

Right-click any function and select **Mark as Entrypoint** to highlight critical entry points. Entrypoints display with:
- Exclamation prefix (`❗️`)
- "entrypoint" label in the description

### Marking Admin Functions

Right-click any function and select **Mark as Admin** to highlight admin/privileged functions that need security-focused review. Admin functions display with:
- Lock prefix (`🔐`)
- "admin" label in the description

Functions can be both entrypoints and admin: `❗️ 🔐 onlyOwner()`

### Progress Tracking

Auditracker automatically tracks your daily audit activity. Use **Auditracker: Show Progress Report** to generate a markdown report showing:

- **Overall Progress**: Current status of functions and files (read/reviewed counts and percentages)
- **Daily Activity Summary**: Table of daily counts for functions read/reviewed, lines of code read/reviewed, and files completed
- **Detailed Activity Log**: For each day, lists exactly which functions were read/reviewed and which files were completed

The report is saved to `.vscode/{repo-name}-audit-progress.md` and opens automatically.

### Panel Information

Each function shows:
- Status icon (○ unread, 👁 read, ✓ reviewed)
- Function name (with ❗️ prefix for entrypoints, 🔐 prefix for admin)
- Line count

Each file shows:
- Relative path
- Review progress (e.g., "3/10 reviewed")

## Requirements

- VSCode 1.85.0 or higher
- Trusted workspace (Auditracker writes tracking files under `.vscode/`)
- Local file system workspace only (no remote/virtual workspaces)
- Single-folder workspace only (multi-root workspaces are not supported)
- Language server for your target language (for symbol extraction)

## Extension Settings

This extension stores state in `.vscode/{repo-name}-auditracker.json` within your workspace, where `{repo-name}` is the name of your workspace folder.

Progress reports are generated at `.vscode/{repo-name}-audit-progress.md`.

If you don’t want to commit these files, add them to your repo’s `.gitignore`:

```
.vscode/*-auditracker.json
.vscode/*-audit-progress.md
```

## Language Support

Works with any language that provides document symbols via VSCode's Language Server Protocol.

**Important**: Install only **one** language extension per language to avoid duplicate or conflicting symbols.
